# Autonomous Truck Analysis and Simulation

This project analyzes California autonomous semi-truck mileage and disengagement data to model remote operator workload and disengagement patterns.

Developed as part of undergraduate research at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, ISyE Department, under Dr. Anthony McDonald.

## Key Features

- Analyzed mileage and disengagement data from California DMV reports.
- Identified optimal distributions (Beta, Gamma, etc.) for modeling autonomous truck behavior.
- Built a Python-based discrete event simulation to evaluate operator staffing under different conditions.

- `Truck_Simulation_Beta.ipynb` – Simulation using best-fit Beta distribution

## Tools Used
